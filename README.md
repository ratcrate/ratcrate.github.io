# Ratatui Ecosystem (ratcrate)

**Ratatui Ecosystem** aggregates and showcases Rust crates built with Ratatui — terminal UI building blocks and apps.

This organization contains the core tools that power and present the Ratatui ecosystem:

- `ratcrate-core` (private) — pipeline that collects crate metadata and builds `ratcrate.json`.
- `ratcrate-cli` — command-line tools for querying and working with the Ratatui registry.
- `ratcrate-tui` — interactive terminal UI for exploring Ratatui crates.
- `ratcrate.github.io` — this website (Currently using React; migrating to Dioxus in progress).
