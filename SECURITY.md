## Reporting a Vulnerability

I take the security of the Ratcrate ecosystem seriously. If you discover a vulnerability in our project, appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

### How to Report a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, pull requests, or comments.**

Instead, please report the issue privately via email 

In your email, please provide as much detail as possible to help us reproduce and fix the issue:

1.  **A detailed description** of the vulnerability.
2.  **Steps to reproduce** the issue (including any specific environment setup, Node/npm versions, or browser details).
3.  **The affected version(s)** of the project.
4.  **Proof of concept** or exploit code (optional, but highly helpful).

### My Response Policy

When a vulnerability is reported privately, here is what you can expect:

| Step | Expected Timeline | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Acknowledgement** | Within 48 hours | Acknowledge receipt of your report and confirm that we are beginning the internal investigation. |
| **Triage & Analysis** | Within 1 week | Provide an initial assessment of the vulnerability's severity and confirm whether it is accepted for remediation. |
| **Remediation Plan** | As required | Once a fix is confirmed, work  with you to plan public disclosure and attribution, typically coordinating with a subsequent release cycle. |
| **Public Disclosure** | Coordinated Release | Issue a security advisory and an announcement after the fix is deployed to protect users who upgrade. |

I am committed to keeping the reporter informed throughout the entire process.
